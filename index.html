        <blockquote>
          I will never forget all the sacrifices and all the compromise you've
          made to make sure I am where I am today. You are an inspiring soul,
          and a caring woman. You ser aside your troubles and took on mine. Your
          home is always open to everyone, and your hospitality made them feel
          important. You are the most loving, humble, compassionate,
          understanding, family-orientated woman and one of the most beautiful
          souls one could ever meet. To the world, you are one person, but to
          me, you are the world. You did not have much, but I always feel like I
          have everything. You teach and show me love, patience and endurance.
          You teach me how to pray and led by example. You praised me whenever I
          did good and pointed out my mistakes. You encouraged me to work hard
          in school and ensure me the future ahead is much more brighter. You
          are the truest, dearest, and more than a mother to me. You are a
          precious gift from God, blessed with so much beauty, grace, love and
          patience. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING. May GOD continue to bless you.
          AMEN
